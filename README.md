# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on patient health data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and a web application for predictions.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values, Scaling, Splitting Data)
- Model Training using RandomForestClassifier
- Model Persistence (Saving and Loading Trained Model)
- Web Application for Predictions (Flask/Streamlit)

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python src/train.py  # Train the model
python app/app.py  # Run the web app
```

## Dataset
The dataset used is `diabetes.csv`, containing health metrics of patients.
